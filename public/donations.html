    <h1>Kyrie Irving's Donations</h1>
    <p>Kyrie Irving’s philanthropic record is as impressive as his on-court skills. His generous donation on December 20th, where he gifted $50,000 to the GoFundMe campaign for Jaheim McMillan—a 16-year-old boy who lost his life due to police violence in Mississippi—underscores his commitment to fighting injustice.</p>
    <p>In another remarkable act, Kyrie bolstered the education of a Howard University student, Destiny Thompson, by contributing $22,000 to her GoFundMe campaign. This donation not only exceeded her goal but also highlighted his dedication to supporting educational opportunities for students in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).</p>
